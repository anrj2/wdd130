    <h2>Abby Joseph</h2>
    <h2>Byby or Nadie</h2>
    <p>I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science to later get an MS, with the hope of getting into ML/AI.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I am taking this class because it is a requirement for my major. I hope to have fun in this class while learning and be creative.
        In the future I might use it in my career or it can be a side hustle job.</p>
    <p>I love a lot of things about BYU-Idaho such as the environment, the standards or learning outcomes, and the people. The campus is small and easy to navigate around.
        Everyone, especially the professors are friendly and always ready to help the students succeed.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Church. It is difficult to pick one favorite scripture. But, one of my favorite quotes is by President Monson, "We were not placed on this earth to walk alone". </p>

    <p>A little bit about me.</p>
